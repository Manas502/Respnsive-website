            </p>
        <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Edusem offers online classes and courses in education covering a broad range of topics from
            educational policy and history to curriculum design and teaching techniques. The economic recession, layoffs, lockdown measures, and the risk of illness caused by COVID-19 make self-employed, remote jobs like online teaching very attractive. The best thing about teaching online is that it’s accessible to so many people. As the education expert Elliot Masie, said, “We need to bring learning to people instead of people to learning.”

        <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">There’s no dress code. Sure, you need to look presentable if you’re on camera, but there are no rules against shorts and flip-flops! There’s also no commute to contend with. You can work remotely from the comfort of your home and avoid wasting time traveling to and from work. Even if you’re hired by an agency you are still your own boss. You decide when you work and how many hours you do. You can take holidays whenever you want or you can work your butt off if you wish so – you are in charge of your time and that’s a very liberating feeling.</p>
